3,Arora et al. (2025),Peroneus Longus to Peroneus Brevis Tenodesis Does Not Improve Ankle Functional Outcomes: A Prospective Cohort Study,"PURPOSE: Peroneus longus (PL) graft harvest has recently gained popularity for various ligament reconstruction surgeries. A recent systematic review shows it is a safe and reproducible technique with low morbidity of donor sites (1). The method for PL harvest routinely involves tenodesis of the PL stump to the peroneus brevis (PB). To the authors' best knowledge, no study exists in the literature that has compared the outcomes of tenodesis versus no tenodesis on post-operative ankle functional outcome scores. The purpose of the present study is to assess the importance of tenodesis on post-operative ankle scores. METHODS: A total of 200 consecutive patients from July 2022 to November 2022 were included in the study: 72 in the no tenodesis group and 128 in the tenodesis group. Institutional ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics review committee before the initiation of the study. Demographic variables (age, gender and level of play) were recorded. Pre-operative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) and Functional Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were calculated for both groups and compared with post-operative scores at six weeks, three months, six months and one-year follow-up. RESULTS: For the entire study population (n = 200), we found that AOFAS and FADI scores showed no significant difference at any interval except for lower scores at six weeks of follow-up for both groups compared to baseline. We found that the no tenodesis group had slightly better AOFAS and FADI scores at the six-week follow-up, which were statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, the magnitude of variance (0.13 and 0.20, respectively) was too small to be clinically significant. Age, gender and level of play had no impact on ankle functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: Tenodesis of the PL to the PB has been the standard norm in PL graft harvest for various ligament surgeries. The present high-powered prospective cohort study shows that tenodesis.does not improve ankle functional outcome scores compared to no tenodesis. Further work is needed to assess the impact of tenodesis or no tenodesis on ankle biomechanics (eversion, plantarflexion and gait). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",10.1007/s43465-025-01361-1
4,Aryana et al. (2025),No Difference in Ankle Morbidity Between the Leg with Peroneus Longus Used for ACL Reconstruction Autograft and the Contralateral Side 12 Months Postoperatively,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries often require surgical intervention. The use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction has been reported to offer significant potential benefits, such as preserving the hamstring tendons. However, its effects on the ankle must be considered prior to surgery. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study evaluating ankle morbidity using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, plantarflexion and eversion strength, and Clarke's angle on both extremities. Data were collected from patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test with SPSS v.26. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included, with the mean AOFAS scores of 58.88 (donor side) and 70.12 (contralateral side). Mann-Whitney test results showed no significant difference in AOFAS scores between the two sides (p=0.085). The mean plantarflexion strength values were 62.23 (donor) and 66.77 (contralateral), with no significant difference (p=0.489). Additionally, the mean Clarke's angle values were 59.10 (donor) and 69.90 (contralateral), with no significant difference (p=0.099). CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference in ankle function in patients who used the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft in ACL reconstruction.",10.52965/001c.144731
6,Chen et al. (2025),Comparative efficacy of different lengths of anterior cruciate ligament stump during reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury affects individuals, and successful ACL helps patients return to an active lifestyle. This study compared the clinical effects of two treatment schemes of retention length ≥ 1/2 and < 1/2 of ACL stump in patients under reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT). METHODS: A total of 34 patients with ACL injury of knee joint treated by unilateral ACL reconstruction with PLT were recruited in this study. They were divided into N1 (retention length of ACL stump ≥ 1/2) and N2 (retention length of ACL stump < 1/2) groups (n = 17 in each group). The knee joint proprioceptive threshold of passive motor perception was used to evaluate recovery of proprioception. The international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score (TAS) were used to evaluate knee joint functions. Lachman test, anterior drawer test (ADT), and pivot shift test (PST) were used to evaluate the stability of knee joint. Single-legged hop test and return-to-sport ratio were used to evaluate the movement ability. RESULTS: In 6th month and 12th month after operation, the passive motor perception threshold in N1 group was better than than that in N2 group (p < 0.05). In 12th month after the operation, the return-to-sport ratio in N1 group was increased compared to the N2 group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in results of IKDC score, Lysholm score, TAS, Lachman test, ADT, or PST between the two groups in 6th month and 12th month after the operation (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found in the single-legged hop test between the two groups in the 12th month after operation (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: During ACL reconstruction with PLT, treatment strategy of ACL stump retention length ≥ 1/2 is more effective than treatment strategy of length < 1/2 for patients with ACL injury of the knee joint.",10.1186/s12893-025-02913-w
13,Karapinar et al. (2025),An Evaluation of the Effect on Ankle Stability of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft Used in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have focused on the effect of the peroneus longus tendon graft on the knee; in this study, we focused on its impact on the ankle. Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are frequently observed in sports injuries. The peroneus longus tendon graft has rapidly gained a place in the literature; however, very few studies have been conducted on the foot-ankle region stability of this tendon. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect on this region of the peroneus longus tendon graft used in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). STUDY DESIGN: Case series, Level of evidence 4. METHODS: The study included 20 out of 35 patients who met the inclusion criteria and had ACLR using a peroneus longus tendon graft at the same orthopaedics and traumatology clinic between January and December 2023.The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Ankle strength measurements were performed, and all the patients were tested with the Y test, the flamingo test, the eyes closed balance test, and the standing on tiptoes test. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score were recorded. RESULTS: The dynamometer measurements of the donor side and the contralateral side were compared. No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the ankle eversion and plantar flexion strength measurements (P = .096, P = .835, respectively). A significant result was obtained in the flamingo test (P = .049). No statistically significant difference was determined between the 2 sides with respect to the anterior, posterior, and lateral distances of the Y test (78.8 vs 78.6 cm, P = .973; 96.6 vs 80.4 cm, P = .053; 89.5 vs 95.0 cm, P = .357, respectively). In the examination of ankle functionality, no statistically significant difference was determined in the Foot and Ankle Disability Index and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score of the 2 sides (P = .798, P = .206, respectively). CONCLUSION: The peroneus longus tendon can be safely used as an alternative autograft in ACLR without causing donor site morbidity. There may be a deficit in balance test performance.",10.1177/23259671251371229
14,Khalil and Zawam (2025),Comparative study of Peroneus longus tendon autograft versus Hamstring tendon autograft in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the functional outcomes and donor site morbidities after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using peroneus longus (PL) tendon versus hamstring (HST) tendon autografts. METHODS: The PL tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 36 patients, and in another group, ACLR was performed using the HST tendon autograft in 35 patients between September 2022 and April 2023. The knee functional outcomes were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and the Lysholm scores at preoperative and at 18 months following ACLR. In addition, the autograft diameter was measured intraoperatively in both groups. Ankle joint donor site morbidities were estimated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) in the PL autograft group. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients, who underwent ACLR, were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 18 months (range 18-20 months). The diameter of the PL tendon autograft was significantly greater than that of the HST tendon autograft (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the functional outcomes between both groups at 18 months follow-up. Evaluation of the AOFAS showed no significant ankle joint dysfunction in the PL tendon autograft group. CONCLUSIONS: PL tendon autograft can be used as a safe and effective autograft choice for ACLR with excellent functional outcomes comparable to HST tendon autograft and minimal donor site morbidity.

15,Kumar et al. (2025),Comparison of Surgical and Non-Surgical Treatment of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury in Middle-Aged Population: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Background The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most commonly injured ligaments of the human body. The main mechanism of injury is usually when a pivoting injury occurs in which the tibia is translated anteriorly. At the same time, the knee is in a slight valgus and flexed attitude, and is predominantly found in contact sports like soccer. The variable symptoms that warrant medical attention usually include pain, swelling, knee giving way, difficulty ambulating, and reduced knee range of motion. The treatment usually depends on the patient's symptomatology, type of injury, the growth remaining in his or her growth plates, and activity goals. The purpose of the study is to determine the superior treatment modality for ACL injury in patients older than 40 years. Methodology The study was a prospective study conducted in the orthopedic outpatient department of a tertiary care center in northern India. A total of 60 patients were included in the study sample. Patients were divided into two treatment groups: Group A (n=30), consisting of conservatively managed patients, and Group B (n=30), consisting of surgically managed patients. Various symptoms during presentation were also noted in the study, which showed pain and instability as the predominant symptoms on presentation. Treatment modalities for ACL injury in our study include conservative management by physiotherapy and surgical management with ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus autograft. The physiotherapy protocol and post-surgery rehabilitation protocol were kept the same to compare the outcome in both groups. The Lysholm knee scoring scale was used to calculate the functional outcome of conservatively and surgically managed groups before intervention and post-intervention at the first, third, sixth, and twelfth months. The data was collected and summarized in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and analyzed with IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., using the ANOVA test, chi-square test, and paired t-test. A p-value of < 0.05 indicated a statistically significant difference. Results The study was conducted with two groups (group A: conservative; group B: surgical group) with comparable demographic profiles and slight male predominance, comparing the functional outcome of surgically and conservatively managed middle-aged patients with ACL injuries. The Lysholm knee scoring scale showed a poor pre-intervention score in both groups. This subsequently improved over a period of one year of study for both groups. After 12 months, a Lysholm Knee Score of 75.80±5.95 (group A) and 96.13±2.65 (group B), with a p-value of < 0.001, was noted, which showed a significantly superior functional outcome of surgical intervention in ACL injury as compared to conservative treatment in the study population. Conclusions Sixty patients over 40 years of age were taken up for the study, with more than two-thirds of the study population being male. The study showed the pre-intervention Lysholm knee scoring scale for both groups to be ""poor."" The score remained ""poor"" even after the first month post-intervention. After 12 months, a Lysholm Knee Score with an ""excellent"" outcome was noted in the surgical group (group B), which depicted an overall superior functional outcome of surgical intervention in ACL injury as compared to conservative treatment in the study population.",10.7759/cureus.84489
17,Pontoh et al. (2025),Anterior Knee Pain Evaluation Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Using Anterior Half of The Peroneus Longus (AHPL) Autograft,"INTRODUCTION: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is crucial for knee stability and joint movement coordination. ACL injuries are common, often leading to knee instability and subsequent complications. ACL reconstruction is a standard treatment option, with various autograft sources available. The anterior half of the peroneus longus (AHPL) tendon has emerged as a potential alternative autograft. This study aimes to examine the anterior knee pain in ACL reconstruction using AHPL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 51 patients with ACL injuries undergoing ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft. Patient demographics, surgical details, and Kujala scores were collected. RESULTS: The average age of our participants was 25.88 ± 5.39 years, with mean BMI classified as obese. Significant improvements in Kujala and KOOS pain scores were observed between each data collection. There was a negative correlation between baseline and three and six months post-operatively Kujala and KOOS pain scores with BMI. DISCUSSION: The study findings suggest that ACL reconstruction using the AHPL tendon autograft significantly reduced anterior knee pain, as indicated by a better Kujala and KOOS pain score. Previous studies have highlighted concerns regarding anterior knee pain with other autograft sources, such as the patellar and hamstring tendons. The AHPL tendon autograft offers a promising alternative with favorable anterior knee pain and minimal donor site morbidity. CONCLUSION: In ACL reconstruction, the AHPL tendon autograft demonstrates excellent outcomes regarding anterior knee pain, as measured by the Kujala score.",10.2147/ORR.S495410
19,Singh et al. (2025),Evaluation of Ankle Complications after Peroneus Longus Tendon Harvesting for ACL Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common and debilitating, often requiring surgical reconstruction. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) is a promising autograft for ACL reconstruction, with less donor site morbidity than traditional grafts like bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring tendons. This study evaluates donor site ankle morbidity after PLT harvesting for ACL reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study at an Indian Government Medical College and Hospital from February 2023 to October 2024 involved 56 patients with symptomatic ACL tears who underwent arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using PLT grafts. Donor site morbidity was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using the visual analog scale for foot and ankle (VAS-FA) and American orthopaedic Foot and Ankle society (AOFAS) scores at 14 days, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Data were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 36.8 years and an average injury duration of 13.3 months. Donor site morbidity occurred in 66.1% of patients, mainly as mild pain and swelling, which improved significantly over time. VAS-FA scores dropped from 7.52 preoperatively to 2.05 at 6 months, and AOFAS scores increased from 54.8 to 80.0. Chronic injury duration (over 16 months) was associated with poorer recovery, while preoperative pain, gender, graft size, and weight-bearing duration had no significant impact on recovery outcomes. CONCLUSION: PLT harvesting for ACL reconstruction leads to minimal donor site morbidity, with mild pain and swelling that improve over time. PLT grafts offer a promising alternative to traditional autografts, providing comparable outcomes and fewer complications. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results.",10.13107/jocr.2025.v15.i06.5718
22,Velioğlu et al. (2025),Harvesting the Full Thickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Is Not Associated With Structural Foot Impairments: A 12- to 23-Year Follow-up Study,"BACKGROUND: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft is suggested as a promising alternative graft option for reconstructive procedures supported by a growing body of evidence indicating favorable results. However, concerns remain regarding long-term functional impairments of the foot and ankle after harvesting a full-thickness PLT. PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term donor site morbidity in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a PLT autograft. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients with harvested PLT autografts, and all eligible patients were invited to participate in a clinical examination at the hospital. To evaluate their range of motion, all included patients underwent a physical examination. Clinical outcomes were measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Activities of Daily Living and Sports subscales of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM-ADL and FAAM-S). To evaluate foot and ankle structural changes, the intermetatarsal angle (IMA), hallux valgus angle (HVA), arc height index (AHI), lateral talo-first metatarsal angle (LTFMA), calcaneal pitch angle (CPA), and metatarsal angle (MA) were measured in the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients who were available for the final follow-up were included in this study. The mean age of the patients at the final follow-up was 45.7 ± 9.5 years. The mean follow-up time was 19.5 ± 3.4 years. AOFAS scores were excellent in 92.3% of patients (n = 24) and good in 7.7% (n = 2). The mean FAAM-ADL score was 99.6 ± 1.86. The mean FAAM-S score was 98.1 ± 5.94. No statistically significant differences were observed between the PLT harvested side and the contralateral side for any of the measured parameters-including the IMA, HVA, AHI, LTFMA, CPA, and MA. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated good to excellent long-term patient-reported outcomes and negligible radiographic changes after harvesting the full thickness PLT compared with the contralateral side. These long-term data strongly support PLT harvesting as an alternative graft choice and suggest that this method does not alter the natural history of foot and ankle structures.",10.1177/23259671251320659
25,Acharya et al. (2024),Functional Outcomes of Anatomic Single Bundle Primary ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon (Without a Peroneal Tenodesis) Versus Hamstring Autografts,"OBJECTIVES: There is a paucity of comparative studies on the Peroneus longus tendon versus conventional hamstring autograft use in primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction. To date, there are no studies that reported donor ankle functional outcomes when a peroneus longus graft is harvested without performing a tenodesis to peroneus brevis. METHODS: A single-center retrospective comparative study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcomes (IKDC & Tegner-Lysholm scores) of primary isolated single bundle anatomic ACL Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus tendon (PL group) versus Hamstring (HT group) autografts. Further, an evaluation of donor ankle morbidity using the AOFAS score for the PL group and persistent anteromedial thigh pain and paraesthesia around the knee for the HT group was also performed. RESULTS: 30 patients were evaluated in each group. The mean graft diameter was 8.61 +/- 0.66mm (HT) & 9.6 +/- 0.84mm (PL) and the mean graft length was 7.39cm (HT) & 7.86cm (PL) respectively. The mean IKDC scores were 58.2 (Pre-op) & 89.52 (1 year) for the HT group and 61.8 (Pre-op) & 90.9 (1 year) for the PL group respectively. The mean Tegner-Lysholm scores were 69.83 (Pre-op) & 91.96 (1 year) for the HT group and 70.66 (Pre-op) & 92.36 (1 year) for the PL group respectively.10% of the HT group had residual anteromedial thigh pain & 6.7% had paraesthesia at one-year follow-up. In the PL group, the mean AOFAS score was 96.37 +/- 2.49 at the end of one year. Two cases (6.66%) reported paraesthesia around the harvested site. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon appears to be a better autograft choice than hamstrings for primary ACL reconstruction. Further, without a peroneal tenodesis, the functional outcomes of the donor ankle remained excellent.",10.22038/ABJS.2024.73473.3404
26,Alardi et al. (2024),PERONEUS LONGUS AUTOGRAFT IN ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION AS ALTERNATIVE GRAFT OPTION,"BACKGROUND: The type of the graft in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is still argument which one is the best regarding hamstring or bone tendon bone graft. Peroneus longus (PL) tendon is emerging good alternative choice in such type of surgery. METHODS: Study done on 30 patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using PL graft and evaluated after 2 years with lysholm knee score and American orthopedic foot and ankle disability index. RESULTS: Two year of surgery, the result 86-95% (good to excellent) in 22 cases (73.3%), 6 (20%) patients with 80-85% (fair to good), and 2 (6.6%) cases with 70% (poor) score without any new insult on the knee. American foot and ankle score was 100 in all 28 patients (93.3) and 96 only in 2 cases (6.6%). CONCLUSION: Good size of the graft and low donor site morbidity as well as good functional outcome may make the PL graft is a favorable graft choice in ACLR.",
30,Asif et al. (2024),Randomized Controlled Study Comparing Hamstring Graft and Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft in Arthroscopic ACL Reconstruction,"INTRODUCTION: Graft choice for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has been evolving. The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been seen as a suitable choice for ACLR, providing comparable results to those of hamstring tendon (HT) autograft, but its clinical relevance in terms of return to sports, to our knowledge, has not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients who sustained an isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent ACLR using tripled or quadrupled PLT autograft (if graft thickness exceeded 10 mm then tripled) or quadrupled HT autograft. Patients were followed for 24 months. Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Tegner-Lysholm scores) were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, and 24-month post-operatively. Graft diameter and graft harvesting time were measured intraoperatively. Donor-site morbidity was evaluated using subjective evaluation. Time to return to sports in both groups was compared. RESULTS: The mean diameter of the PLT autograft was significantly larger than that of the HT autograft, and the mean graft harvesting time was less (P < 0.001). Patients in the PLT group returned to sports a mean of 36 days earlier than those in the HT group (P < 0.001) and had a lower rate of donor-site morbidity, and better patient-reported outcomes at the knee (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference between the groups in IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores at the 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Despite some donor site complications, such as numbness and infection, both PLT and HT grafts offer acceptable knee stability. However, PLT grafts seem to provide superior subjective functional outcomes based on patient-reported scores. More research is needed to further establish these findings and optimize graft choices for individual patients.",10.13107/jocr.2024.v14.i11.4980
32,Butt et al. (2024),5-years outcomes following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction comparing quadruple hamstring and peroneus longus tendon autografts: a randomized control trial,"AIMS: This study presents clinical outcomes, functional results, and return to sports after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using quadruple hamstring tendon autograft or peroneus longus tendon autograft in a randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 2018 and July 2019, patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: hamstring and peroneus longus. Patient related outcome measurements and pain intensity were evaluated using IKDC, Lysholm, and visual analog scores at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, and 5 years after the surgery. At the 5 year follow-up, anterior stability was tested using the 3D printable Knee Arthrometer. In addition, in the peroneus longus group, ankle functional assessment was performed using the American foot and ankle score. Additionally, data on the return to sports/activities was collected for both groups at the last follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty patients, with 30 in the hamstring group and 30 in the peroneus group, were included in the study. Patients were predominately male and with low activity demands. After five years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in functional assessment scores (IKDC and Lysholm) between the two groups (P n.s). The median graft diameter was 7.9 ± 0.4 mm in the hamstring tendon group and 8.9 ± 0.2 mm in the PL group (P < 0.001). The improvement in Arthrometer testing measurements (AMT) for the operated knees in the hamstring and peroneus longus groups were similar. In the peroneus longus group, the mean postoperative foot and ankle score was 98.6 ± 3.9 (range = 85-100). CONCLUSION: Using Peroneus longus tendon autograft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction is a feasible alternative as studied in this cohort of predominately male patients with low activity demands. The graft diameter in this study was sufficient, and the results regarding laxity and patient related outcome measurements were similar to those achieved with hamstring tendon autografts.

34,Oliveira et al. (2024),Evaluation of the peroneus longus tendon as an autologous graft in knee surgery,"Our hypothesis is that the peroneus longus (PL) is a great option for ligament reconstruction in the knee, and therefore the objective of the study is to determine if the use of this graft is safe and does not cause secondary damage to the harvested area. A prospective study was conducted between April 2019 and September 2022. Patients who underwent any type of knee ligament reconstruction using the PL or just the anterior half (AHPL) as grafts were followed up. These patients were evaluated according to the Tegner-Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) guidelines for functional evaluation of the knee and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) for the functional evaluation of the ankle. Most patients had an increase in the IKDC score, Tegner-Lysholm score, AOFAS and FADI regardless of the graft used in the surgical procedure, with mean values at the 24-month follow-up of, respectively, 99.02± 0.02, 98.69± 0.08, 99.92± 0.07, and 99.92± 0.07 for those with PL grafts and 99.31± 0.54, 98.88± 0.95, 100± 0.00, and 100± 0.00 for those with AHPL grafts. The differences in the scores between the two graft groups during each of the follow-up periods were significant (P = 0.001). The use of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft in knee surgeries was shown to be adequate for achieving good knee functional results.",10.1038/s41598-024-76779-y
35,Dwidmuthe et al. (2024),"Functional Outcome of Single-Bundle Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction using Peroneus Longus Graft and Hamstring Graft: An Open-Label, Randomized, Comparative Study","Background This study investigates the functional outcomes of single-bundle arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, comparing the use of two distinct graft sources: peroneus longus (PL) graft and hamstring graft. The choice of graft material in ACL reconstruction is crucial for optimal postoperative results, and this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the comparative efficacy of these two graft types. Method This open-label randomized comparative study involved a carefully selected cohort of patients undergoing single-bundle arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PL graft group or the hamstring graft group. Surgical procedures were conducted using standardized techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation protocols were closely monitored. Functional outcomes, including range of motion, stability, and patient-reported measures, were assessed at predefined intervals to ensure comprehensive data collection. Results The study underscores significant demographic and clinical factors in ACL reconstruction outcomes. Participants were predominantly aged 17-30 years (58.33%) with a mean age of 29.27 years and exhibited a male predominance (80.56%). Common complaints included knee pain and instability, primarily due to falls from bikes (55.56%) or sports-related trauma (44.44%). Notably, PL grafts demonstrated advantages over hamstring grafts, with longer mean length (10.11 mm vs. 8.77 mm, p=0.0001) and shorter operation times. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner Lysholm scores show no significant differences between grafts over the period of time. There is no notable foot eversion weakness or significant donor site morbidity after the PL graft harvest. Hamstring graft cases exhibit a higher incidence of altered sensation and muscle atrophy, suggesting the potential benefits of PL grafts for improved surgical outcomes. Conclusions Graft comparisons favored PL grafts due to longer length, and functional outcome assessments between the two graft types. However, foot and ankle strength assessments revealed fluctuations in strength recovery with PL grafts, highlighting the need for tailored rehabilitation. Thigh circumference variations suggested potential muscle atrophy in the hamstring graft group, along with reported paresthesia in the ipsilateral proximal leg. In conclusion, PL grafts offer potential advantages for ACL surgery, but ongoing monitoring and specialized rehabilitation are crucial.",10.7759/cureus.60239
36,Ertilav et al. (2024),Donor Site Morbidity after Removal of FullThickness Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction: 4-Year Follow-up,"PUSPOSE OF THE STUDY. Many studies have investigated the efficacy of peroneus longus tendon (PLT) in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and donor site morbidity has not been adequately studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using PLT were included. Ankle strengths of the patients evaluated with an analog dynamometer. Ankle range of motion (ROM) was measured with a smart phone inclonometer application. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the postoperative ankle strength(eversion, plantar flexion) in the donor area and the preoperative period (p=0.6 and p=0.7, respectively) and contralateral healthy side (p=0.6, p=0.6, respectively). Ankle ROM angles (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, inversion) were significantly lower in the post-operative period compared to the preoperative period and contralateral healthy side (p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, p<0.05, respectively). There was no significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative AOFAS scores (p=0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Although PLT can affect ROM angles, it is a promising alternative for ACL reconstructions without causing functional morbidity.

37,Farey et al. (2024),Outcomes of ACL Reconstruction Utilizing Supercritical CO(2)-Sterilized Allografts,"BACKGROUND: Allograft tendons are perceived to have a high ACL graft failure rate in primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR). Historical series may be biased by graft processing methods that degrade the biomechanical properties of donor tendons such as irradiation. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) is a validated method of terminally sterilizing biomaterials at physiological temperatures without irradiation, but in vivo use of SCCO2-processed tendon allografts for primary ACLR has not been reported to date. HYPOTHESIS: ACLR with SCCO2 allografts would result in acceptable failure rates, subjective knee scores, and clinical evaluation at 2 years postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Patients underwent primary ACLR with terminally sterilized SCCO2-processed human gracilis, peroneus longus, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, and tibialis posterior tendon allografts. Patient demographics were collected, along with tendon donor age and sex. At 1 year postoperatively, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and ACL-Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scores were collected, as well as clinical evaluation. At 2 years postoperatively, the IKDC and ACL-RSI scores were repeated, and return to sports and further knee injuries were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 144 patients with a medianage of 26 (IQR 14) years formed the study group. Patients were predominately male (58%). The loss to follow-up rate was 8% (n = 12). The mean age of allograft tendon donors was 37 (range 17-58) years, and the majority were male (83%). The mean allograft diameter was 8.9 ± 1.0 mm. At 2 years, ACL graft failureoccurred in 5% (n = 7). All graft failureswere in patients aged ≤25 years (P = .007). Neither donor age (≤40 or >40 years) nor donor sex was associated with graft failure (P > .05). The median IKDC subjective score was 95 and ACL-RSI score was 75. There were no revisions for sepsis within the first 2 years postoperatively. CONCLUSION: SCCO2 processing of allograft tendons demonstrated satisfactory clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 24 months postoperatively in a consecutive series of patients with primary ACLR, with similar ACL graft failure rates and subjective knee scores compared with those reported in published series of hamstring tendon autograft and fresh frozen nonirradiated allograft.",10.1177/23259671241254115
39,Gök et al. (2024),Peroneus Longus vs Hamstring Tendon Autografts in ACL Reconstruction: A Comparative Study of 106 Patients' Outcomes,"BACKGROUND Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction commonly uses a hamstring tendon autograft, but the peroneus longus tendon can also be used. This study aimed to compare outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 106 patients using peroneus longus tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. MATERIAL AND METHODS ACL repair was performed on 54 patients using a hamstring tendon autograft and 52 patients with a peroneus longus tendon autograft. Knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, while the ankle was evaluated using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the Foot &amp; Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores. Donor-site morbidity and graft characteristics were compared. RESULTS There was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of knee IKDC and Lysholm scores (p=0.49, p=0.68, respectively). The diameter of the peroneus longus tendon graft (8.56±0.93) was significantly larger than the hamstring tendon (7.44±0.6) (p<0.001). The peroneus graft harvesting time was significantly shorter (p<0.001). Thigh hypotrophy and donor-site morbidity were significantly higher in the hamstring group (p<0.001 and p=0.006). The donor ankle AOFAS score was 93.46±3.8, and the FADI score was 93.48±4.6. No morbidity associated with the peroneus longus graft was observed. CONCLUSIONS Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using the peroneus longus tendon experienced faster knee rehabilitation and less donor-site morbidity, such as thigh hypotrophy and knee pain. The peroneus longus tendon, with its larger diameter, fewer graft-related complications, and similar knee scores compared to the hamstring group, is considered a suitable alternative graft source.",10.12659/MSM.945626
42,Kilic et al. (2024),Relationship between peroneus longus tendon graft thickness and anthropometric variables: a radiographic study using ultrasonography,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of anthropometric measurements for two-stranded peroneus longus tendon (PLT) graft thickness using ultrasonography MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 204 healthy volunteers (102 males and 102 females) aged 18-40 years. Anthropometric measurements were recorded, including height, weight, body mass index (BMI), fibular length, calf circumference, and ankle circumference. The Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) was used to assess activity levels. PLT cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured using ultrasonography. Two-stranded PLT graft thickness was calculated using the previously reported formula by Luo et al. A thickness of less than 8 mm of PLT graft was accepted as an insufficient autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Correlation and regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of two-stranded PLT graft thickness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to establish the best threshold values. RESULTS: Males had a significantly greater PLT CSA (0.17 ± 0.03 cm2) and predicted two-stranded PLT graft thickness (8.1 ± 0.6 mm) compared with females (0.15 ± 0.03 cm2 and 7.5 ± 0.6 mm, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Correlation analysis revealed that two-stranded PLT graft thickness positively correlated with height, weight, BMI, fibular length, calf circumference, ankle circumference, and Tegner Activity Scale in both genders, with stronger correlations observed in females. The logistic regression model identified height and calf circumference as significant predictors of sufficient two-stranded PLT graft thickness (≥ 8 mm) in males, while calf circumference and the TAS were significant predictors in females. ROC analysis demonstrated that calf circumference and the TAS had acceptable discriminatory abilities in females, with 36.25 cm and ≥ 4 cutoff points, respectively. However, no anthropometric variables in males exhibited strong discriminatory abilities for predicting two-stranded PLT graft thickness CONCLUSIONS: Calf circumference and the TAS are significant predictors for two-stranded PLT autograft thickness in females. However, no anthropometric variables in males could be used strongly for prediction. These anthropometric measurements can assist in preoperative planning and decision-making, potentially improving ACLR outcomes by ensuring adequate graft thickness in females.

44,Mirza et al. (2024),Donor-site morbidity following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft,"INTRODUCTION: Peroneus longus has proved to be a promising graft for ACL reconstruction due to its high tensile strength, and ease of harvesting. While multiple studies have assessed the functional outcomes of the knee after ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft, we aimed to evaluated donor site morbidity among the Indian population. MATREIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Preoperative AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores were obtained, and patients were followed up after surgery for a period of 6-months using the same scoring systems and strength testing with a hand-held Chatillon MSE-100-M dynamometer. Pedobarographs were done using Diers Pedoscan Plantar Pressure Measurement System on a subset of seven patients. RESULTS: 20 patients participated in the study. Mean AOFAS and Karlsson-Peterson scores pre-operatively were 99.7 ± 1.34 and 98.5 ± 4.62 respectively. On completing 6- months of follow-up these scores were found to be 95.6 ± 9.43 and 88.75 ± 18.42 respectively. Deterioration of mean evertor strength was noted at all follow-ups compared to the opposite side. Static pedobarographs showed significant decreased in total surface area of contact and pressure over the posterior aspect of the operated side by 3-months which improved later at 6-months. Dynamic pedobarographs showed decreased mean average plantar pressure while walking on the operated side and significant increase in mean surface area of contact of the operated side (191.886±22.678 cm2) at 6-months of follow-up compared to the opposite side (184.471 ± 22.218 cm2). Five patients showed deviation of the point of maximum pressure while walking on the operated foot making it lateral to the COP with increased lateral plantar/ medial plantar pressure ratio. CONCLUSION: While the use of peroneus longus tendon autografts in arthroscopic ACL reconstruction does not seem problematic on short-term subjective assessment, there is objective evidence in keeping with evertor weakness, weakness of first ray plantar flexion and possible ankle instability.

46,Pilar et al. (2024),Evaluating the Efficacy of Peroneus Longus Tendon as an Autograft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Indian Female Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Background Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are prevalent, especially among active individuals, and are increasingly observed even in Indian women who are not active in sports. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is commonly performed using various graft options, but optimal choices for women remain debated. The aim of our study was to examine the use of the peroneus longus tendon as an autograft for ACLR in Indian female patients. Materials and methods A prospective cohort study was carried out on 44 non-athlete female patients who met the inclusion criteria. The study evaluates functional outcomes using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm-Tegner, and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, as well as knee stability through clinical tests, over a one-year postoperative period. Results The study demonstrates significant improvements in knee function, with substantial increases in IKDC and Lysholm-Tegner scores from preoperative levels (p-value < 0.01), and effective restoration of knee stability, as shown by improved Lachman, Anterior Drawer, and Pivot Shift test results. Moreover, the peroneus longus graft had minimal impact on ankle morbidity, as indicated by consistent AOFAS scores before and after surgery. Conclusion The study highlights the peroneus longus tendon as a viable graft option for ACLR in symptomatic Indian female patients who were not active in sports, offering both mechanical strength and favorable functional outcomes without affecting the ankle strength or the function.",10.7759/cureus.71665
47,Punnoose et al. (2024),"Peroneus Longus Tendon Autografts have Better Graft Diameter, Less Morbidity, and Enhanced Muscle Recuperation than Hamstring Tendon in ACL Reconstruction","BACKGROUND: Recently the peroneus longus tendon (PLT) gained popularity in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and has been utilized with satisfactory outcomes. However, there are concerns regarding donor site morbidity. This study aims to compare the functional outcome of ACL reconstruction using hamstring (HT) and PLT autografts and evaluate the donor site morbidity. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (HT and PLT). Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Knee functional outcome was evaluated with IKDC and Tegner-Lysholm scores preoperatively, and postoperatively after 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements, subjective evaluation of sensory disturbances, and ankle scoring with AOFAS and FADI scores. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, the PLT group showed comparable IKDC (p = 0.925) and Tegner-Lysholm (p = 0.600) scores with those of the HT group. The mean graft diameter in the PLT group (7.93 ± 0.52 mm) was larger compared with the HT group (7.43 ± 0.50 mm) (p < 0.001). The incidence of thigh atrophy (HT-16.7%, PLT-10%) and sensory disturbances (HT-73.3%, PLT-10%) was greater in the HT group. There was no significant ankle donor site morbidity in the PLT group (AOFAS-98.67 ± 3.45, FADI-99.23 ± 1.69). CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction with PLT had comparable functional outcome with that of HT at 1 year. However, PLT demonstrated larger graft diameter, less donor site morbidity, and enhanced muscle recovery without significantly affecting the ankle function. PLT can be safely used as an acceptable alternative graft choice harvested from outside the knee for ACL reconstruction.",10.1007/s43465-024-01185-5
49,Shetty et al. (2024),Arthroscopic Reconstruction of Injured Anterior Cruciate Ligament Using Peroneus Longus Graft With Fixed Loop Endobutton - A Prospective Study,"INTRODUCTION: ACL injuries are more common amongst active young people where RTA and sports injuries predominate as the most common methods of injury ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus graft method have been used more frequently nowadays. The advantages of peroneus longus graft are, Adequate graft length of minimum of 25 to 30 cm. Adequate thickness of minimum 8.5 to 9mm,Less incidence of graft thinning, Lesser hamstring and quadriceps weakness, Minimal donor site morbidity. Minimal restriction of ankle movements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 25 patients with injured anterior cruciate ligament without meniscal injury within the age group of 18-55 years managed with arthroscopic reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament with peroneus longus graft and fixed loop endobutton at femoral side and interference screw at tibial side. Functional outcome was assessed using clinical examination, International Knee Documentation committee and Lysholm knee scoring scale, FADI score (foot and ankle disability index score). Patients were followed up at 2, 4, 8, 12weeks and 6, 8 months post-operatively. RESULTS: This study consists of 25 cases of Anterior Cruciate Ligament injury. ACL rupture was common in second and third decade of life. In our study, 18(63.34%) were sports related injuries, 5(26.66%) were due to road traffic accidents and 2(10%) were atraumatic degenerations. 22(80%) showed excellent results and 3(20%) showed good results. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus graft and Fixed-loop Endobutton and interference screws provided excellent post-operative clinical outcome in terms of knee stability, subjective knee and ankle function and range of movements of the knee and ankle in our study.",10.13107/jocr.2024.v14.i10.4872
50,Soni et al. (2024),Functional Outcomes in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction: A Nine-Month Follow-up Study Using Lysholm Score in a Rural Tertiary Care Center in India,"Introduction The knee joint, an extraordinary feat of biomechanics, is prone to injuries, with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) often being a common victim. The intricate coordination of joint movements relies heavily on the ACL's screw-home mechanism, a crucial element for synchronizing knee movement with neighboring joints. Despite its indispensable role, the ACL is susceptible to injury, necessitating surgical intervention. While many patients experience positive outcomes following ACL reconstruction surgeries, a significant proportion face the challenge of procedure failure. The key to success lies in the healing process within the tibial and femoral bone tunnels. The post-ACL reconstruction phase introduces its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of returning to sports (RTS), underscoring the importance of reinstating neuromuscular and motor function. The trajectory of rehabilitation is influenced by factors such as graft healing, patient age, gender, pain levels, and concurrent injuries. Materials and methods This prospective observational study spanned 2.5 years, enrolling 71 patients with diagnosed ACL injuries. Arthroscopic reconstruction utilized hamstring autografts and peroneus longus autografts. A nine-month post-surgery follow-up employed the Lysholm scoring system for comprehensive evaluations. Results Over 2.5 years, 87.3% of male and 12.6% of female participants underwent arthroscopic reconstruction. Lysholm scores revealed 28.1% excellent, 45.0% good, and 26.7% fair outcomes, with no participants in the unsatisfactory range. Lysholm scores demonstrated positive outcomes, indicating the efficacy of arthroscopic reconstruction in enhancing knee function. Findings align with existing literature, emphasizing positive results from ACL reconstruction techniques and specific implants. Comparisons with related studies highlight challenges in standardized return-to-sport guidelines and underscore the need for outcome measure standardization. Conclusion The study contributes nuanced insights into ACL reconstruction outcomes, emphasizing positive functional recovery trends at the nine-month follow-up. Lysholm scores indicate favorable outcomes, supporting the procedure's effectiveness. Consideration of specific implants adds practical value. Despite limitations, this study enriches ACL reconstruction research, promoting advancements in patient care and outcomes. Ongoing research with extended follow-ups and larger cohorts will enhance understanding and refine ACL reconstruction strategies.",10.7759/cureus.53480
53,Zhang et al. (2024),The Efficacy of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon and its Impact on Ankle Joint Function,"OBJECTIVE: Peroneus Longus Tendon (PLT), a viable anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft, shares similar biomechanics, making it suitable for reconstruction. Controversy exists over whether PLT transplants affects the donor ankle joint. The purpose of this study was to examine the recovery of knee joint function following arthroscopic ACL restoration using autologous PLT and its influence on the donor ankle joint. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with ACL rupture who underwent PLT graft reconstruction in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2021. A three-dimensional gait analysis of the bilateral knee and ankle joints was performed postoperatively using an Opti_Knee three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system-Yidong Medical Infrared Motion Gait Analyzer. Knee function scores and changes in the range of motion of the bilateral knee and ankle joints were collected. The analysis of preoperative and postoperative joint function scores, bilateral knee and ankle mobility was performed by t-tests. RESULTS: One year after surgery, the patients' International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOSs), and Lysholm scores were significantly improved compared to preoperative scores, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of the donor ankle joint before and after surgery (p > 0.05). During different gait cycles, there was no statistical difference in knee joint mobility between the affected and healthy sides (p > 0.05), but there was a statistical difference in the inversion and eversion angle of the donor ankle joint during the support phase (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction using the PLT can yield satisfactory knee joint function. However, it does affect inversion and eversion in the donor ankle joint, necessitating postoperative exercises. Similar subjective function ratings for both operated and non-operated feet, despite increased inversion-eversion motion in the operated foot, may be influenced by the subjective nature and margin of error in the AOFAS Ankle-hindfoot score, along with the relatively small variation in ankle inversion-eversion angles.",10.1111/os.14060
54,Zhao et al. (2024),The effect of harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon on foot morphology and gait,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, the strength of the graft was found to be unsatisfactory usually the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was taken for supplementation, but the effect on foot and ankle function and gait in the donor area is unclear. This study aims to explore the changes in the ankle and gait after using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a reconstruction graft for the anterior cruciate ligament. METHODS: A total of 20 patients, 6 males and 14 females, aged 18 to 44 years, with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament injuries, underwent reconstruction using the harvested anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon as a graft between June 2021 and December 2021. The part on which the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon was harvested was considered the experimental group, while the contralateral foot was the control group. At the 6-month follow-up, the Lysholm knee score, AOFAS ankle score, and gait-related data (foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, and gait cycle parameters: percentage of time in each gait phase, step frequency, step length, foot strike angle, and push-off angle) were assessed using a 3D foot scanner and wearable sensors for both groups. RESULTS: All 20 patients completed the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups regarding knee scores, ankle scores, foot length, arch index, arch volume, arch volume index, step frequency, and step length (P > 0.05). However, there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in terms of the gait cycle parameters, including the percentage of time in the stance, mid-stance, and push-off phases, as well as foot strike angle and push-off angle (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Through our study of the surgical experimental group we have shown that harvesting the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon does not affect foot morphology and gait parameters; however, it does impact the gait cycle.",10.1186/s13018-023-04429-6
55,Agarwal et al. (2023),Comparison of Functional Outcomes of an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Reconstruction Using a Peroneus Longus Graft as an Alternative to the Hamstring Tendon Graft,"Background Ever since the arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) has begun, the use of the peroneus longus (PL) graft for primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has never been thought of. There is very little literature on it. Hence, our study aims to compare the functional outcomes, knee stability, donor site morbidity, and assessment of thigh muscle wasting in patients with ACL injury managed by arthroscopic single bundle reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon (PLT) and hamstring tendons (HT), respectively. Methods All adults aged 16-50 years of either gender presenting with symptoms of symptomatic ACL deficiency were admitted for arthroscopic single-bundle ACLR and allocated into two groups (peroneus longus and hamstring tendon). Functional scores (International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm score), clinical knee evaluation (anterior drawer, Lachman, and pivot shift test), donor site morbidity (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot score (AOFAS)), and thigh circumference were recorded preoperatively and at six months and one year postoperatively. The same post-op rehabilitation protocol was followed in both groups. Results One hundred and ninety-four patients (hamstring n = 96, peroneus n = 98) met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences between the preoperative, six-month postoperative, and one-year postoperative scores between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (p=0.356) and Lysholm knee score (p=0.289). The mean for the AOFAS was 99.05 ± 3.56 and 99.80 ± 0.70 in the PLT and HT groups, respectively, showing no statistical difference, with a significant improvement in thigh muscle wasting among the PLT group at final follow-up (p < 0.001). Conclusion We observed similar knee stability and functional outcomes and no obvious donor site morbidity among both groups. These patients also had better responses to physiotherapy in recovering from their thigh muscle wasting. So, we can recommend that a PL graft can be a safe, viable, and effective option for usual arthroscopic single-bundle ACL reconstruction.",10.7759/cureus.37273
59,Cakar et al. (2023),Complications of peroneus longus tendon harvesting: a retrospective review of 82 cases,"OBJECTIVE: Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has become a reliable autologous graft option for various ligament reconstructions. But there are potential risks and complications associated with its use as a graft. This retrospective study aimed to examine the complications and donor site morbidity following PLT harvesting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on an institutional digital patient database, and all patients who underwent ligament reconstruction using PLT autograft were identified. Intraoperative, early, and late complications were reviewed using digital patient notes and patients underwent a complete physical examination during their final follow-up. Ankle function was assessed using the AOFAS score, and manual ankle muscle testing was performed on both sides. Sural nerve iatrogenic injury was evaluated with a dermatomal light touch examination. Cosmetic satisfaction due to incision scar and footwear complaints were also assessed. RESULTS: 82 patients (74 male, eight female) with a mean age of 31.9 ± 10.4 years (range, 16-66) were included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up time was 46.6 ± 30.3 months (range, 6-109). The mean AOFAS score for the donor side was 98.7 ± 3.3 (range, 87-100), and the contralateral side score was 100, with manual muscle testing graded as 5 in all movements and similar to the contralateral side. Fifteen patients (18.3%) had hypoesthesia over the dorsolateral aspect of the foot distal to the incision scar, two patients (2.4%) had hyperalgesia over the distal incision scar, and one patient (1.2%) had mild ankle instability. There were two cases (2.4%) of compartment syndrome, both of which were treated with fasciotomy and had complete regression of symptoms after 5 days. One patient (1.2%) had a transient peroneal nerve injury and foot drop that resolved in the sixth month. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study suggest that harvesting the PLT is associated with a high rate of complications and donor site morbidity. The most common complication was hypoesthesia around the lateral side of the foot, although the ankle functions were not affected significantly. Two cases of compartment syndrome and one transient peroneal nerve injury were observed. Care should be taken while harvesting PLT autograft, and it should be kept in mind that peroneal nerve injury might occur.

63,Goyal et al. (2023),Full-thickness peroneus longus tendon autograft for anterior cruciate reconstruction in multi-ligament injury and revision cases: outcomes and donor site morbidity,"PURPOSE: Peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft has been successfully used for isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction cases. Being a powerful evertor and flexor of great toe, there might be associated ankle morbidity with this autograft option. However, there are only a few studies exploring whether the ankle morbidity is significant or not. This study aims to assess the functional outcomes, donor site morbidity, and ankle strength after harvesting ipsilateral peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction in revision ACL and multi-ligament injury cases. METHODS: This was a prospective case series. All of the patients were evaluated by clinical examination for knee for laxity, ankle joint stability, and using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Lysholm score, preoperatively and postoperatively at two-year follow-up. Morbidity of donor ankle was assessed using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, bilateral evertors, and first ray plantarflexion strength measurement using an isometer (Innovative Design Orthopedics) at two-year follow-up. RESULTS: Ipsilateral PLT graft was used in ten patients of revision ACL reconstruction and 27 patients of the multi-ligament knee injury. The mean length of PLT harvested (cm) was 26.2 (standard deviation 2.6, range 22-31), and mean diameter of the doubled graft (mm) was 7.9 (standard deviation 0.68, range 7.5-8.5). There was a significant improvement in VAS score for pain, Lysholm, and IKDC scores (p =  < 0.001) at two -year follow-up. There were no cases of graft failure, superficial, or deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion(p = 0.32), ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.19), eversion strength(p = 0.6), first ray plantarflexion strength(p = 0.52), and AOFAS score(p = 0.29) were found to be comparable to the normal side in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Peroneus longus autograft can be considered as a potential autograft option for ACL reconstruction in multi-ligament knee injuries and revision ACL reconstruction. No significant donor site morbidity was noted at follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.",10.1007/s00590-021-03145-3
64,Hossain et al. (2023),A prospective study of arthroscopic primary ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft: Experience of 439 cases,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are frequent ligamentous injuries that necessitate reconstruction in many cases. The patellar tendon and the hamstring tendon are the most frequently utilized autografts for reconstruction. However, both have certain disadvantages. We hypothesized that the peroneus longus tendon would be an acceptable graft for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to determine whether a peroneus Longus tendon transplant is a functionally viable option for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction without compromising donor ankle activity. In this prospective study 439 individuals aged between 18 to 45 years, who underwent ACL reconstruction using ipsilateral Peroneus longus tendon autograft were observed. The injury to the ACL was initially assessed by physical examinations and further confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The outcome was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months after the surgery using Modified Cincinnati, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Tegner-Lysholm scores. The donor ankle stability was evaluated using foot and ankle disability index (FADI) and AOFAS scores, as well as hop tests. Significant (P < .001) improvement in the result of the IKDC score, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score was observed at the final follow-up. The Lachman test was mildly (1+) positive only in 7.70% of cases, the anterior drawer became negative in all cases, and the pivot shift test was negative in 97.43% of cases at 24 months after the surgery. FADI and AOFAS scores for donor's ankle functional assessment were impressive, as were single hop test, triple hop test, and cross over hop test results at 2 years. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. However, 6 cases of superficial wound infection were observed, 4 at the port site and 2 at the donor site. All resolved after appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. The peroneus longus tendon can be considered a safe, effective, and promising graft of choice for arthroscopic primary single-bundle ACL reconstruction because it has a good functional outcome and impressive donor ankle function after surgery.",10.1097/MD.0000000000032943
66,Josipović et al. (2023),A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR COMBINED ANTERIOR CRUCIATE AND ANTEROLATERAL LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION USING QUADRICEPS AND PLANTARIS TENDONS,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions with quadriceps tendon (QT) grafts are gaining popularity, both in primary and revision procedures. Recently, the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in improving rotational knee stability has been emphasised and concurrent ACL and ALL reconstruction is advocated. In this paper, a new technique utilising the QT and the plantaris tendon (PLT) for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction is analysed. Patients that underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using QT and PLT grafts in a 3-years period were prospectively analysed. A total of 9 patients with 6 months minimum follow-up were assessed with Lachman and Pivot shift clinical tests, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale. One patient had reconstructed ACL re-rupture at the final follow-up visit, leaving 8 patients with a mean follow-up of 19±8 months. There was a significant improvement in anteroposterior and rotational stability in all the patients. The IKDC, KOOS, and Lysholm scores improved as well. The Tegner activity scale increased postoperatively, however, it did not reach preinjury values. QT and PLT grafts are valuable alternatives for currently used grafts in combined ACL and ALL reconstructive procedures. This new technique is a reasonable option in ACL revision surgery and a good alternative in primary ACL and ALL reconstruction, especially when hamstring grafts are not advised or they are missing.",10.20471/acc.2023.62.s3.6
70,Sahoo and Sahu (2023),Analysis of Postural Control following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction with Ipsilateral Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"INTRODUCTION: Harvesting peroneus longus for ACL reconstruction is thought to create ankle instability which could add to postural instability from an ACL injury. This apprehension prevents its use as a graft of primary choice for many surgeons. To date, there is no evidence available describing changes in postural control after its use in ACL reconstruction. The purpose of the study was to analyse the changes in postural control in the form of static and dynamic body balance after ACL reconstruction with Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft and compare it with the unaffected limb at different time intervals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one participants with ACL injury were selected and subjected to an assessment of static and dynamic balance before and after ACL reconstruction using the HUMAC balance system. Outcome measures for Centre of Pressure (COP) assessment were average velocity, path length, stability score, and time on target. Comparison of scores was done pre-operatively as well as at three- and six-months post-reconstruction with Peroneus longus tendon graft. RESULTS: Static balance of the affected limb showed significant improvement with a decrease in average velocity (F=4.522, p=0.026), path length (F=4.592: p=0.024) and improvement of stability score (F=8.283, p=0.001). Dynamic balance measured by the time on the target variable also showed significant improvement at six-month follow-up (F=10.497: p=0.000). There was no significant difference between the affected and non-affected limb when compared at the different time intervals. CONCLUSION: The static and dynamic balance, which is impaired after ACL injury, improves with ACL reconstruction with PLT autologous graft. Hence PLTG can be safely used as a graft for ACL reconstruction without affecting postural control and body balance.",10.5704/MOJ.2303.016
72,Wierer et al. (2023),Peroneus Longus Split Versus Semitendinosus Tendon Autograft Size: A Cross-sectional Study,"BACKGROUND: The anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) has been reported to be a suitable autograft for ligament reconstruction with low donor-site morbidity. However, clinical data on graft size are limited. PURPOSE: To determine (1) if there is any difference in size between the AHPLT and semitendinosus tendon (ST) and (2) whether anthropometric measurements can predict autograft size. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 128 consecutive patients scheduled for knee ligament reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Patients were treated with AHPLT (50%) or ST (50%). Data included anthropometric measurements and intraoperatively recorded graft size. A Student t test was used to determine differences between the groups. Bivariate correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses were calculated to identify relationships between graft size and anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: The AHPLT and ST groups were equally distributed according to age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). The quadrupled graft length for the AHPLT was 7.3 ± 0.6 cm as compared with 7.5 ± 0.7 cm for the ST (P < .05). The quadrupled graft diameter was 7.7 ± 0.8 mm for the AHPLT and 8.0 ± 0.7 mm for the ST (P < .05). Height had a moderate (r = 0.57) to high (r = 0.68) correlation with AHPLT and ST length, respectively (P < .01). Weight had a moderate correlation (r = 0.43) with AHPLT diameter (P < .01) but only a weak correlation (r = 0.19) with ST diameter (P > .05). A significant interaction effect of BMI and thigh circumference on ST graft diameter was found, which showed that the effect of thigh circumference on ST graft diameter decreased significantly as BMI increased (P < .05). This moderating effect of BMI could not be observed for the coefficient of shank circumference on AHPLT graft diameter (P > .05). CONCLUSION: (1) The peroneus longus split tendon provides a reliable autograft size for knee ligament reconstructions. It was prone to be slightly shorter and thinner than the ST. (2) Patient height was the strongest predictor for AHPLT and ST graft length. However, predicting graft diameter based on thigh or shank circumference was more challenging, with higher BMIs affecting the ability to predict ST more than AHPLT.",10.1177/03635465231165297

77,Keyhani et al. (2022),Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft versus Hamstring Tendon Autograft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Comparative Study with a Mean Follow-up of Two Years,"BACKGROUND: Peroneus longus tendon can be a suitable alternative autograft for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The present study aimed to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACLR using peroneus longus tendon autograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. METHODS: In a comparative cross-sectional study, ACLR was performed with quadrupled hamstring tendon autograft in 65 patients between 2017 and 2018, and in another group, peroneus longus tendon autograft was used for ACLR in 65 patients between 2018 and 2019. The same surgical technique, fixation method, and postoperative protocol were used in both groups. The knee functional outcomes were assessed according to the Lysholm score and the International Knee Documentation Committee scale at preoperative and at the end of at least 2 years after the procedure. Moreover, graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Thigh circumference, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), The Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI), and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate ankle donor site morbidities. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients (65 patients in each group) were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range 24-31 months). Both groups showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes and knee stability. The peroneus longus graft diameter was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (P<0.001). Assessment of AOFAS, FADI, and ankle ROM showed no apparent ankle joint dysfunction in the peroneus longus tendon group. CONCLUSION: Faster knee extensions, less anteromedial knee pain, and thigh hypotrophy were observed in peroneus longus tendon patients. Peroneus longus tendon autograft can be an appropriate autograft for ACLR due to its strength, larger graft diameter, and avoiding potential complications of hamstring autograft obtained from the knee region.",10.22038/ABJS.2022.59568.2938
81,Rajani et al. (2022),Functional and clinical outcome of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft and correlation with MRI after 3 years,"INTRODUCTION: Autograft options for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction over the years have gone from bone-patellar tendon-bone to hamstring to peroneus longus tendon. Considering the drawbacks of other autografts, we analyse peroneus longus autograft holistically as a viable alternative. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 113 patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft between January 2017 and November 2018 for isolated, full-thickness ACL tears. Functional analysis was done using the Tegner-Lysholm score pre-operatively, at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years postoperatively. At terminal follow-up, stability was checked clinically by Lachman test, residual morbidity of donor site was assessed using foot and ankle disability index, and radiographic correlation was done with magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The mean diameter of the graft after tripling was 9 ± 0.71 mm and the average length before tripling was found to be 27.07 ± 2.76 cms. At terminal follow-up, 101 patients showed excellent, while 12 patients showed good outcomes. The mean foot and ankle disability index was 94.8 ± 3. 90.27% of patients had no laxity on clinical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging of all the patients at terminal follow-up showed good graft uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Peroneus longus autograft shows intraoperative consistency and gives excellent functional outcome, clinical stability, and no donor site morbidity even three years postoperatively.",10.1016/j.jor.2022.08.027
83,Singh et al. (2022),A Study of the Functional Outcome of Supplementation of Hamstring Graft With Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon in Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,"INTRODUCTION: The present study was done to analyze the functional outcome, donor site morbidities, and associated parameters when using the anterior half of the peroneus longus for augmentation of an inadequate hamstring graft when performing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. METHODS: Thirty patients with complete ACL tears were operated on. In all these patients, the thickness or length of the hamstring graft taken was found to be inadequate (less than 8 mm and 7.5 cm, respectively). So, additionally, the anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) graft was harvested to reach an optimum size of the final graft. Functional outcome was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at six weeks, three months, and six months. The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) score at six months was used to assess ankle stability. RESULTS: The mean age in our study was 28.8 years with male predominance (73.33%). The mean operative time was 86.4 minutes. The mean hamstring graft thickness in our study was 6.5 mm, which improved to 9.12 mm after augmentation. The mean graft length after AHPLT augmentation was 9.38 cm. The mean IKDC score at six months was 87.35. At the end of six months, FADI scores were found within normal limits (range: 135-136) in all the patients. No complications were noted in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: The AHPLT graft was always found to be sufficient enough for augmenting the hamstring graft to reach an acceptable thickness and length. There was no graft site morbidity and the ankle functional levels remained the same as preoperative levels, making it an excellent choice for augmentation of inadequate hamstring grafts.",10.7759/cureus.30138
85,Bi et al. (2021),All-Inside Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using an Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"BACKGROUND: The peroneus longus tendon (PLT) has been used as a graft in many orthopaedic surgical procedures because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Despite its potential, few studies have been performed to investigate the clinical reliability of ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft. PURPOSE: To assess the clinical outcomes and donor-site morbidity of ACL reconstruction using an anterior half of the PLT (AHPLT) autograft in patients with an isolated ACL injury. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between January 2016 and January 2017, a total of 21 patients with an isolated ACL injury underwent all-inside single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft. Knee stability was assessed using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and KT-2000 arthrometer (side-to-side difference) with 134-N anterior force and at 30° of knee flexion. Knee function was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Donor-site morbidity was assessed using ankle eversion and plantarflexion strength as well as the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society scoring system and the Foot and Ankle Disability Index. RESULTS: At a mean final follow-up of 40.1 months (range, 36-48 months), the KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference was significantly lower compared with preoperatively (1.1 ± 0.62 vs 7.0 ± 2.18 mm, respectively; P < .001). The mean preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm, and Tegner scores were 52.0 ± 8.27, 50.9 ± 8.50, and 1.8 ± 0.87, respectively, increasing significantly to 94.2 ± 2.61, 95.2 ± 2.64, and 6.8 ± 1.50, respectively, at final follow-up (P < .001 for all). All patients had grade 5 muscle strength in ankle eversion and plantarflexion at the donor site, with mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society and Foot and Ankle Disability Index scores of 96.8 and 97.6, respectively. No complications or reoperations occurred. CONCLUSION: All-inside ACL reconstruction using an AHPLT autograft produced good functional scores and stability without obvious ankle-site morbidity.",10.1177/2325967121991226
90,Ertogrul et al. (2021),Is Peroneus Longus Allograft Good Alternative for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: a Comparison Study,"PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To compare the early clinical results of patients who had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with peroneus longus allograft versus hamstring tendon autograft. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were included in the study. Patients were grouped by their graft preference. Lachman and Pivot-shift tests were performed to the patients. Laxity was measured by KT-1000 arthrometer test with 15, 20 and 30 pound power. The maximum force values of nonoperated knee and the operated knee were recorded with Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer (HUMAC) and compared to each other. International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form, modified Lysholm and Cincinnati evaluation forms were compared between two groups. RESULTS Twenty patients included into peroneus longus allograft (Group 1) and 20 patients were included into hamstring autograft group (Group 2). The mean age of patients Group 1 and 2 were 34.25 ± 6.73, and 29.6 ± 4.55, respectively. No significant difference was noted between two groups at modified Lysholm, Cincinati and IKDC scores (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Lachman and Pivot hift levels (p > 0.01). No significant difference was found in KT-1000 device measurements between groups according to the performed techniques (p > 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between Cybex extension-flexion 60 /sec measurement and extension 240 /sec measurement of the patients (p > 0.01). DISCUSSION Allografts can be preferred because of the advantages, such as lack of donor site morbidity, short operative time, large graft, small incision, minimal scar, good cosmetic appearance, less postoperative pain, less movement restriction, and less arthrofibrosis. However, there are disadvantages, such as disease transmission, low biocompatibility, immune response, long recovery time, and high cost. Although it is difficult to compare the stability and functionality of allografts and autografts because of the differences in graft processing, fixation methods, and surgical techniques in studies, similar clinical results are reported in long-term follow-ups CONCLUSIONS Graft preference is dependent on surgical experience, patient age, activity status, comorbidities, presurgical status, and patient decision. Allograft ACL reconstruction is a good alternative to arthroscopic ACL reconstruction performed with hamstring tendon graft. Key words: anterior cruciate ligament, peroneus longus allograft, hamstring autograft, ACL reconstruction.",
93,Goyal et al. (2021),Outcomes of one-stage reconstruction for chronic multiligament injuries of knee,"PURPOSE: This article aims to evaluate patterns of chronic multiligament injuries and outcomes of treatment with single-stage reconstruction using autografts. METHODS: All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6 weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years' follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48 ± 9.9 years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2%) or chondral (40.7%) injuries. At the 2 years' follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p = 0.0001) IKDC score (p = 0.0001), Lysholm score (p = 0.0001), and range of motion (p = 0.001). None of the patients had residual laxity on clinical examination of the knee joint at the 2 years' follow-up. All but two of the patients went back to their previous activity level. These two patients had progressive knee arthritis and needed knee arthroplasty. CONCLUSION: Single-stage surgical reconstruction for chronic MKI has favourable functional outcomes.

95,Joshi et al. (2021),Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Safe and Effective Alternative in Nonathletic Patients,"INTRODUCTION: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a common injury which has been conventionally managed by various graft reconstruction using bone patellar tendon bone, or quadruple hamstring autograft, to name a few. However, all these grafts are associated with many complications. Lately, peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft has shown promising results in this field, although there is still a dearth of data on its use. We, therefore, aimed at carrying out a study to evaluate the functional outcome and knee stability results of ACL reconstruction using PLT graft. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a completely torn ACL were included in the study. The PLT was harvested, and graft length, thickness, and harvesting time were noted intraoperatively. Knee stability and functional scores were evaluated clinically and using Lachman test (primarily) and KT-2000 arthrometer and subjectively with International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score at 6, 12, and 24 months (secondary outcome) postoperatively. Ankle scores were also recorded by making use of American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS)-Hindfoot Scale. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria. The graft harvest time was 7.4 min (5-9 min). The mean thickness of the graft on doubling was 7.9 mm (7-9 mm). Ninety-six percent of the patients were satisfied with their results of the knee surgery, and 95% of the patients had no complaints of ankle joint. The mean IKDC score postoperatively was 78.16 ± 6.23, and the mean AOFAS score was 98.4 ± 4.1. None of the patients had any neurovascular deficit. CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction using PLT graft yields a good functional score (IKDC, KT-2000 arthrometer) even at 2-year follow-up. It is a safe and effective autograft option for ACL reconstruction.",10.4103/njs.NJS_22_20
101,Zhong et al. (2021),[Study on reconstruction of posterior cruciate ligament with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy],"OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effectiveness of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy. METHODS: Between January 2016 and December 2018, 46 patients with PCL injuries were enrolled. There were 34 males and 12 females, with an average age of 40.7 years (range, 20-58 years). There were 43 cases of acute injury and 3 cases of old injury. The anterior drawer test and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 4 cases, the posterior drawer tests and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 46 cases, the varus stress tests were positive in 10 cases, and the valgus stress tests were positive in 6 cases. The difference of dial-test at 30° knee flexion between affected and healthy sides was (5.20±3.91)°. The tibia posterior displacement under posterior stress position was (12.03±2.38) mm. The Lysholm score of the knee joint was 36.68±7.89, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score was 33.58±5.97, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Association (AOFAS) score of the ankle joint was 97.60±1.85. PCL was reconstructed with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy, and the combined meniscus injury, posterolateral complex injury, and anterior cruciate ligament injury were all treated according to the degree of injury. RESULTS: All incisions healed by first intention. Forty patients were followed up 12-26 months, with an average of 16.0 months. At last follow-up, the Lysholm score of the knee joint was 84.85±7.03, and the IKDC score was 87.13±6.27, which were significant different from preoperative ones ( t=-13.45, P=0.00; t= -39.12, P=0.00); the AOFAS score of ankle joint was 93.98±2.14, which was not significant different from preoperative one ( t=8.09, P=0.90). The tibia posterior displacement under posterior stress position was (2.75±1.76) mm and the difference of dial-test at 30° knee flexion between affected and healthy sides was (1.75±2.09)°, which were significant different from preoperative ones ( t=29.00, P=0.00; t=4.96, P=0.00). The posterior drawer test and the posterior tibia sign were positive in 1 case and negative in 39 cases; the anterior drawer test and the varus and valgus stress tests were all negative. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of PCL with autologous peroneus longus tendon under arthroscopy can significantly improve the stability and function of the knee joint, with satisfactory clinical results.",10.7507/1002-1892.202008051
103,Rhatomy et al. (2020),Single bundle ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon graft: 2-years follow-up,"BACKGROUND: Peroneus longus tendon autograft resembles hamstring tendon's biomechanical strength. Thus, peroneus longus is a potential graft in reconstructive orthopaedic procedures. However, there was few study in evaluation of peroneus longus usage in ACL reconstruction. This study aimed to quantify the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity in ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus tendon autograft. METHODS: Patients who suffered isolated ACL injury were enrolled and underwent isolated single bundle ACL reconstruction using peroneus longus autograft. Functional score (IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score) were assessed at pre-operative and 2-years after surgery. Graft diameter was measured intraoperative. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurement and ankle scoring using AOFAS and FADI. We also measured serial hop test. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Peroneus longus graft diameter was 8.38 ± 0.68 mm. There was significant difference between pre and 2-years post-operative functional score in IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, and Tegner-Lysholm score. Mean of AOFAS was 98.93 ± 3.10 and FADI was 99.79 ± 0.59 with no significant decrease of thigh circumference, and good serial hop test result. CONCLUSION: ACL reconstruction with peroneus longus autograft has excellent functional score in IKDC, Modified Cincinnati, Tegner-Lysholm score at 2-years follow up with the advantages of greater graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy, good serial hop test result, and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI score.

109,Rhatomy et al. (2019),Peroneus longus autograft can be recommended as a superior graft to hamstring tendon in single-bundle ACL reconstruction,"PURPOSE: A peroneus longus tendon autograft is used in many orthopaedic procedures and it is biomechanically comparable to a hamstring tendon autograft. Despite its potential, there are few studies that have evaluated the use of the peroneus longus tendon in ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and donor site morbidity of ACL reconstruction with hamstring tendon autografts versus peroneus longus tendon autografts in patients with an isolated ACL injury. METHODS: Patients who underwent isolated single-bundle ACL reconstruction were allocated to two groups (hamstring and peroneus longus) and observed prospectively. Graft diameter was measured intraoperatively. Functional scores (IKDC, modified Cincinnati and Lysholm scores) were recorded preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Donor site morbidities were assessed with thigh circumference measurements and ankle scoring with the AOFAS and FADI. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (hamstring n = 28, peroneus n = 24) met the inclusion criteria. The peroneus longus graft diameter (8.8 ± 0.7 mm) was significantly larger than the hamstring diameter (8.2 ± 0.8 mm) (p = 0.012). There were no significant differences between the pre- and 1-year postoperative score between the hamstring and peroneus longus groups in the IKDC (n.s), modified Cincinnati (n.s), and Lysholm (n.s). The mean for the AOFAS was 97.3 ± 4.2 and for the FADI 98 ± 3.4 in the peroneus longus group, with a significant decrease in thigh circumference in the hamstring group (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus autografts produces a functional score (IKDC, modified Cincinnati, Lysholm) comparable to that of hamstring autografts at a 1-year follow-up, with the advantages of larger graft diameter, less thigh hypotrophy and excellent ankle function based on AOFAS and FADI scores.

110,Rhatomy et al. (2019),Eversion and First Ray Plantarflexion Muscle Strength in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using a Peroneus Longus Tendon Graft,"BACKGROUND: The peroneus longus tendon has been used as a graft in orthopaedic reconstruction surgery because of its comparable biomechanical strength with the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and hamstring tendon. However, one of the considerations in choosing an autograft is donor site morbidity. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to compare ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength between the donor site and its contralateral site after ACL reconstruction. The study hypothesis was that strength measurements will be different between the harvest site and contralateral healthy site. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACL reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon autograft between March 2017 and December 2018 were included in this study. Patients followed a rehabilitation protocol from the first day after surgery. Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength were measured using a modified dynamometer 6 months after surgery. Donor site morbidity was assessed 6 months after surgery using the Foot & Ankle Disability Index (FADI) and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring system for the ankle and hindfoot. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients (22 male, 9 female; mean age, 27.58 ± 8.69 years [range, 18.00-45.00 years]) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in ankle eversion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .55), with means of 65.87 ± 7.63 N and 66.96 ± 8.38 N, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference in ankle first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site compared with the contralateral site (P = .68), with means of 150.64 ± 11.67 N and 152.10 ± 12.16 N, respectively. The mean FADI score of 99.71 ± 0.57 and mean AOFAS score of 98.71 ± 3.03 at the donor site were considered excellent results. CONCLUSION: Ankle eversion and first ray plantarflexion strength at the donor site were similar to those at the contralateral healthy site, with no donor site morbidity. This suggests that the peroneus longus tendon is a promising graft in ACL reconstruction.",10.1177/2325967119872462
111,Rhatomy et al. (2019),Influence of anthropometric features on peroneus longus graft diameter in Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction: A cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is the most common ligament injury during sports activities that was treated with ACL reconstruction. Nowadays, peroneus longus is used in ACL reconstruction. However, it is difficult to predict the peroneus longus graft diameter for ACL reconstruction. Thus, preoperative measurements are very important to predict peroneus longus autograft for ACL reconstruction. METHODS: A cohort retrospective study was conducted using consecutive sampling method from February 2016 until October 2017 in our center. We recorded patients' characteristics include gender, age, body weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) preoperatively. We measured peroneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively, and analysed data using Spearman correlation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. There were 28 males and 11 females in the peroneus group. From the patients' mean characteristics, age was 25.10 ± 9.16, body weight 71.23 ± 14.17, height 169.13 ± 8.81, and BMI 20.96 ± 3.44. Intraoperative peroneus longus diameter measurement was 8.56 ± 0.82. Spearman correlation showed significant correlation between intraoperative peroneus longus diameter with patient's height, body weight, and BMI with p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Patients' characteristics including gender, height, weight, and BMI in preoperative measurements can predict peoneus longus graft diameter intraoperatively.",10.1016/j.amsu.2019.10.023
113,Shi et al. (2019),Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft is a Safe and Effective Alternative for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction,The ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon (PLT) was utilized as an autograft for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction of patients with acute ACL rupture and grade III medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury. We investigated the efficacy and safety of this alternative autograft compared with autologous hamstring tendon (HT). Biomechanical testing of the graft options was performed and compared with the native ACL. Thirty-eight patients with acute ACL ruptures and grade III MCL injuries were treated with ACL reconstruction with a doubled autologous PLT or quadrupled autologous HT. Knee stability and function was evaluated clinically with the Lachman test and KT-2000 arthometer as well as subjectively with functional scores. Effects on the donor ankle were evaluated by biomechanical testing. The ultimate tensile strengths of doubled PLT and quadrupled HT were significantly higher than that of the native ACL and the ultimate tensile strength of doubled PLT was comparable with that of quadrupled HT. There were no significant differences in clinical or functional scores between the two groups. There were no significant differences in pre- and postoperative biomechanical testing of the donor ankle. PLT is a suitable alternative autograft for an ACL reconstruction in patients with a concomitant grade III MCL injury without a significant biomechanical disadvantage to the ankle donor site.,10.1055/s-0038-1669951
115,Trung et al. (2019),Preliminary Result of Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Using Anterior Half of Peroneus Longus Tendon Autograft,"BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the most successful operations in sports medicine. At present, ligament autografts have been the best method due to good histocompatibility, rapid healing, no cross-contamination, and low cost of treatment. However, autografts do not have infinite amount and are also not always feasible. Anterior half of peroneus longus tenden autograft is likely to become a source of autograft with many advantages. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT). AIM: To evaluate the initial outcome of ACL reconstruction arthroscopy by anterior half of peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: This is a prospective non-controlled case series. RESULTS: A prospective study on 30 patients (from 9 / 2016 to 01 / 2019) had both ACL and MCL injury who had operated ACL reconstruction using anterior half of peroneus longus tendon autograft (AHPLT) at Department of General Orthopaedic and Trauma, Viet Duc hospital. Our outcome: the year average 35.4 ys, the rate of ACL rupture combined with meniscus injury was 40%. The average diameter AHPLT autograft is 7.0 mm. The function Lysholm scores improved from 59 to 94.27 postoperative 6 months. No difference beetwen the AOFAS scale of preoperative and postoperative. CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon is recommended to be a safe and practical autograft resource for arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.",10.3889/oamjms.2019.390
117,Wu et al. (2019),[Arthroscopic GraftLink technique reconstruction combined with suture anchor fixation for anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament injuries],"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of arthroscopic GraftLink technique reconstruction combined with suture anchor fixation in treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture and medial collateral ligament (MCL) grade Ⅲ injury. METHODS: Between June 2015 and February 2018, 28 patients with ACL rupture and MCL grade Ⅲ injury were treated. Arthroscopic GraftLink technique was used to reconstruct ACL with autologous peroneus longus tendon (PLT), and suture anchor fixation was used to repair MCL. There were 22 males and 6 females, aged 21-47 years, with an average age of 30.4 years. The cause of injury included traffic accident in 18 cases, falling from height in 7 cases, and sports injury in 3 cases. The time from injury to admission was 1-2 weeks, with an average of 1.3 weeks. The preoperative Lysholm score of knee joint was 46.8±3.0 and the International Knee Documentation Commission (IKDC) score was 49.2±2.7. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of ankle joint was 98.29±0.72. Both Lachman test and valgus stress test were positive. There were 8 cases of meniscus injury and 2 cases of cartilage injury. RESULTS: The operation time ranged from 55 to 90 minutes, with an average of 72.5 minutes. All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no complications related to operation occurred. All patients were followed up 6-38 months, with an average of 20.7 months. At 3 months after operation, the range of motion of the knee joint was 116- 132°, with an average of 122°. Lachman test showed that the anterior translation more than 5 mm in 2 cases, and the others were negative; while the valgus stress test showed that all patients were positive. At 6 months after operation, the Lysholm score and IKDC score of knee joint were 90.2±1.8 and 93.5±2.3, respectively, which were significantly higher than preoperative scores ( t=31.60, P=0.00; t=29.91, P=0.01); AOFAS score of ankle joint was 97.86±0.68, with no significant difference compared with preoperative score ( t=2.89, P=0.08). KT-1000 test showed that the difference of anterior relaxation between bilateral knee joints was less than 2 mm in 25 cases and 3 to 5 mm in 3 cases. CONCLUSION: The method of ACL reconstruction via arthroscopic GraftLink technique with PLT and MCL repair via suture anchor fixation has the advantages of less knee injury and faster recovery, and there is no significant impact on ankle function after tendon removal.",10.7507/1002-1892.201812062
118,Bi et al. (2018),All-Inside Single-Bundle Reconstruction of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament with the Anterior Half of the Peroneus Longus Tendon Compared to the Semitendinosus Tendon: A Two-Year Follow-Up Study,"The anterior half of the peroneus longus tendon (AHPLT) has been reported to be acceptable for ligament reconstruction with respect to strength and safety. However, there is little information regarding the clinical outcomes after using the AHPLT compared with other autograft tendons. A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to compare the results of 62 cases of all-inside anatomical single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using the AHPLT and 62 cases using semitendinosus graft with an average of 30.0 ± 3.6 months' follow-up. Tunnel placements of enrolled cases were measured on three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) and X-ray imaging. Knee stability was assessed using the anterior drawer test, pivot shift test, and KT-1000. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 2000 subjective score was used to evaluate functional outcomes. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) and the assessment of eversion muscle strength were performed to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. Tunnel positions, which were confirmed with 3D CT, were in the anatomical positions. At the final follow-up, there were no significant differences between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group in the IKDC score (90.4 ± 7.1 vs. 89.3. ± 8.4), KT 1000 measurements (1.71 ± 0.57 vs. 1.85 ± 0.77), pivot shift test, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0.15 ± 0.36 vs. 0.10 ± 0.30). No obvious ankle site complications were found at 24 months. The average AOFAS score of the AHPLT group was comparable to that of the semitendinosus tendon group (99.1 ± 1.40 vs. 99.5 ± 1.21). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or knee stability between the semitendinosus group and the AHPLT group at the 2-year follow-up. An AHPLT autograft may be a good alternative for all-inside ACL reconstruction with respect to its strength, safety, and donor site morbidity.",10.1055/s-0038-1627466
134,Liu et al. (2015),Half-peroneus-longus-tendon graft augmentation for unqualified hamstring tendon graft of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: In some situations, harvested hamstring tendon grafts are not qualified for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This study aimed to present a reinforcing method with additional half peroneus longus tendon (half-PLT) graft augmentation. METHODS: Eight cases underwent ACL reconstruction with unqualified hamstring tendon grafts (diameter <7 mm) and were salvaged by additional half-PLT graft augmentation. The pivot shift test and KT-1000 tests were performed 3 years after surgery. Functional evaluation of subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores was also done. In addition, Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) scores were used to evaluate the function of the ankle donor site. RESULTS: The diameter of unqualified four-strand hamstring tendon grafts was 6.2 mm on average (range, 6.0-6.5 mm). The average diameter of hamstring grafts with half-PLT augmentation was 9.6 mm (range, 9.5-10.0 mm). The pivot shift test was negative in all patients. No significant differences between normal and abnormal knees were found by KT-1000. The average IKDC score was 86.0 (range, 83 to 89), and the average Lysholm score was 84.4 (range, 80-90). The average FADI score for the donor sites of half-PLT was 135.8 (range, 134-136). CONCLUSIONS: Additional half-PLT can successfully and safely reinforce unqualified hamstring tendon grafts for ACL reconstruction.",10.1007/s00776-015-0744-2
136,Nazem et al. (2014),Can we use peroneus longus in addition to hamstring tendons for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction?,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible effects of removing the peroneus longus on the ankle and gait parameters, in order to add insufficient hamstring tendons for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this controlled clinical trial, 375 patients with ACL rupture who underwent ACL reconstruction arthroscopically using hamstring tendons in the orthopedic clinics of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2010 and 2011 were selected. Fifteen patients were included because their hamstring tendon diameter was lower than 8 mm and peroneus longus was added. After 6 months, the patients were followed using ""Kistler force plate"" to detect 3D kinematics and kinetics of the ankles and spatiotemporal walking parameters. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between both operated and non-operated ankles in flexion/extension range of motion (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the moments of both ankles in sagittal and coronal planes (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference between the moments of both ankles in the transverse plane (P = 0.006). There was a significant difference in the force of operated and non-operated ankles in all three planes (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the mean values of spatiotemporal gait parameters between operated and non-operated sides (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Removing the peroneus longus tendon has no effect on gait parameters and does not lead to instability of the ankle. So, it can be used as an autogenous graft in orthopedic surgeries.",10.4103/2277-9175.132696
138,Cao et al. (2012),[Treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injury with peroneus longus tendon],"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus tendon and observe the clinical outcomes of ankle joint after the resection of peroneus longus tendon. METHODS: From January 2006 to December 2009, 35 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries were recruited to undergo surgical procedures. There were 30 males and 5 females with an average age of 31.8 years (range: 21 - 56). All anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions underwent arthroscopy. All ligaments were reconstructed with peroneus longus tendon and fixed with absorb screw. The post-operative assessments included the followings:clinical evaluations, Lysholm knee score, KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale AOFAS). RESULTS: All cases were followed up for an average follow-up period of 15 months (range: 12 - 24). The healing time was 6 - 15 weeks.according to the Lysholm knee score, their outcomes were excellent (n = 25), good (n = 6), fair (n = 3) and poor (n = 1). The average score was 97.2 (range: 60 - 100). The rate of excellent and good was 88.6%; according to the KT-3000 arthrometer evaluations, the outcomes were normal (n = 28), nearly normal (n = 4), abnormal (n = 2) and poor (n = 1). Preoperatively, the average anterior displacement was 11.59 ± 1.25 mm and the average anterior displacement at final follow-up 1.76 ± 1.83 mm. The average AOFAS score was 96.3 (range: 84 - 100). Lysholm knee score and KT-3000 arthrometer evaluation had statistical differences (P < 0.05) while AOFAS score showed no difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Peroneus longus tendon can be a good substitute of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. And its resection has no major influence for ankle joint.",
140,Zhai et al. (2010),[Tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone],"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and variation of tunnel enlargement after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone. METHODS: ACL reconstructions with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone were performed in 18 patients (18 knees)in the study from March 2007 to July 2009. Among the patients,14 patients were male and 4 patients were female, ranging in age from 21 to 47 years, with an average of 35.5 years. Twelve patients had the injuries in the right knee and 6 patients in the left knee. The CT scans were taken in a consistent manner at the 1st week and the 3rd, 6th, 12th months after surgery to measure tibial and femoral tunnel expansion. RESULTS: Tunnel enlargement didn't happen in 18 knees. The average enlargement of 18 cases of femoral tunnel was (1.10 +/- 0.42) mm; and the average enlargement of 18 cases of tibial tunnel was (1.00 +/- 0.51) mm. There was statistical significance of femoral tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); and there were no significant difference of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and the 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05). There was statistical significance of tibial tunnel between the 1st week and the 3rd month after surgery (P < 0.05); there were no significant differences of the tunnel diameters among the 3rd, 6th, and 24th months postoperatively (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with peroneus longus muscle combined with BMP and allogeneic bone could obviously reduce the incidence of tunnel enlargement. The tunnel diameter obviously increase in 3 months after surgery,and it remains basically unchanged later.",
142,Kerimoğlu et al. (2008),[Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the peroneus longus tendon],"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a peroneus longus tendon (PLT) autograft. METHODS: The study included 29 patients (27 males, 2 females; mean age 30 years; range 21 to 39 years) who underwent ACL reconstruction using a PLT autograft and interference nail fixation. Fourteen patients (48.3%) also had partial meniscectomy during surgery. The results were assessed according to the Lysholm scores and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scale at the end of at least five years of follow-up. RESULTS: According to the IKDC scale, 17 patients (58.6%) were rated as normal or nearly normal, and 12 patients (41.4%) were rated as abnormal or severely abnormal. The mean Lysholm score was 83.7 (range 45 to 100), with excellent or good results in 23 patients (79.3%). Radiographic examination showed mild (n=10) or moderate (n=1) degenerative changes in the knee joint. Compared with the normal side, no flexion or extension losses occurred in the affected knees. Stability of the ACL was assessed by the Lachman test, which showed normal findings in 12 patients (41.4%), while nine patients had 1+, five patients had 2+, and three patients had 3+ anteroposterior laxity. Pivot-shift test was negative in 13 patients (44.8%); ten patients had 1+ pivot glide, and six patients had 2+ pivot shift. Two patients (6.9%) complained of mild to moderate pressure pain, paresthesia and dysesthesia at the donor site of PLT. No patient experienced ankle joint dysfunction or difficulty in sports activities due to PLT graft transfer. CONCLUSION: Our data show that PLT can be an appropriate autograft source for ACL reconstruction, avoiding potential complications of autografts obtained from the knee region.",10.3944/aott.2008.038
