**Types** of machine learning:

  - unsupervised learning
  - semi-supervised learning
  - supervised learning
  - reinforcement learning

**Tasks** of machine learning:

  - clustering[^1]
  - classification
  - regression <!-- important for meta-regression -->

[1]: clustering with unsupervised learning can be used as input for supervised learning (i.e., semi-supervised)
