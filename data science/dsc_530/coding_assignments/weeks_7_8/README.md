In this assignment, you will learn how to create, customize, and enhance data visualizations using Python’s powerful plotting libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. You will begin by exploring the fundamentals of visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib, gaining practical experience in generating various types of plots.



Setup your assignment notebook with access to the Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 data files from Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas (Molin, 2021) and use Jupyter Lab/Notebook to complete the following problems:



Exercises 1 - 4 in Chapter 5 from Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas (Molin, 2021)

Create the following visualizations using what you have learned up to this point in this book. Use the data from this chapter's data/ directory:



Exercise 1.

Plot the rolling 20-day minimum of the Facebook closing price using pandas.



Exercise 2.

Create a histogram and KDE of the change from open to close in the price of Facebook stock.



Exercise 3.

Using the earthquake data, create box plots for the magnitudes of each magType used in Indonesia.



Exercise 4.

Make a line plot of the difference between the weekly maximum high price and the weekly minimum low price for Facebook. This should be a single line.



Exercises 1 - 2 in Chapter 6 from Hands-On Data Analysis with Pandas (Molin, 2021)

Create the following visualizations using what we have learned so far in this book and the data from this chapter. Be sure to add titles, axis labels, and legends (where appropriate) to the plots:



Exercise 1.

Using Seaborn, create a heatmap to visualize the correlation coefficients between earthquake magnitude and whether there was a tsunami for earthquakes measured with the mb magnitude type.



Exercise 2.

Create a box plot of Facebook volume traded and closing prices and draw reference lines for the bounds of a Tukey fence with a multiplier of 1.5. The bounds will be at Q1 − 1.5 × IQR and Q3 + 1.5 × IQR. Be sure to use the quantile() method on the data to make this easier. Pick whichever orientation you prefer for the plot, but make sure to use subplots.



Submission Instructions:



Use Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to complete all the exercise problems and submit your code solutions with clearly displayed code outputs in one ipynb file.
You may convert your ipynb file as a PDF file for submission, but this is not required. If you want to make your work available in PDF format, you will have to install the necessary Python packages to do that. Other methods, such as print screens or print to PDF often produce a distorted image of your Jupyter Notebook and if the instructor cannot clearly see your solutions and outputs, your work will be rejected.
You must show all your code and the successfully produced outputs along with documentation to be considered for full credit. 
The assignment is due by Sunday of Week 8, 11:59 p.m. CT.
